# Welcome!

Welcome to this Learning Lab course about working in large repositories. Whether you're working in repositories with a lot of history, with many collaborators, or all of the above, it's important to know how to navigate your workspace.

In this course, you'll learn how to find relevant issues and pull requests, search history to find context, and make connections within GitHub to help others find things too.

### Cross-linking issues and pull requests

GitHub has special capabilities to help reference other information on GitHub. For example, if someone links to a GitHub issue from another GitHub issue (even just by `#3`), a link is created to the other issue. At the same time, another link is created in the referenced issue, referencing the issue with the comment. This two-way reference helps people track relationships across GitHub.

## Step 1: Find an issue

Below, you will see a reference to another issue. In that other issue, a reference was made to _this_ issue. The other issue appears to be a duplicate, so it would be a good idea to close it.
