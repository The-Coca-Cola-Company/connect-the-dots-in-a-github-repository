# Context

## Step 4: Give more context

### :keyboard: Activity

Can you please give some context about the commit? Or ping me in the pull request where it was created? Finding history is not about who screwed up, but really about the bigger picture. Why were decisions made? Who was involved, who requested it, who approved it, etc.
