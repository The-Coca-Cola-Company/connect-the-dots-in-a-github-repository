# More commit context

Historical context of development includes references to other related work, like tests and ways to track work in a sprint.

Work is rarely unplanned and teams use a myriad methodologies and tools to manage their project work. The Projects tab in a GitHub repository or organization, gives teams a lightweight but powerful way to connect work products to planning within a project.


### Real life examples

If you'd like to see what this looks like in active repositories, take a look at [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/pulls) or [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls). You can look through pull requests, see pull request statuses, and maybe even see the log outputs.

## Step 5: Find the broken build

There's an open pull request in this repository with a failing status. Before we fix it, let's figure out the work stream that it originated from, find it, and fix it!

### :keyboard: Activity: Find a pull request

1. Locate the pull request in the **Done** column.
1. Move the pull request to the **In progress** column.
1. Click on the pull request.
1. Using the **Assignees** section on the right side, assign yourself to the pull request
