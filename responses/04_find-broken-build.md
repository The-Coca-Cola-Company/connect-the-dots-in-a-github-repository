# More commit context

Historical context of development includes references to other related work, like tests.

### Real life examples

If you'd like to see what this looks like in active repositories, take a look at [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/pulls) or [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls). You can look through pull requests, see pull request statutes, and maybe even see the log outputs.

## Step 5: Find the broken build

There's an open pull request in this repository with a failing status. Before we fix it, let's find it!

### :keyboard: Activity:

1. In the [Pull requests tab]({{ repoUrl }}/pulls), find the pull request with the failing build
2. Using the **Assignees** section on the right side, assign yourself to the pull request
