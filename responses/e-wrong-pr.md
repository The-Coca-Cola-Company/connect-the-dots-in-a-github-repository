The pull request you moved into the project isn't the one I expected. If you go back to commit {{ commit }}, you'll notice that it's pointing to pull request #5. Let's add that pull request to the project.

1. Go to PR #5.
1. In the pull request, click on **Projects** on the right side, and choose the `v1.0.0` project from the list.
1. Click on where it says _Awaiting triage_, and click on the **In Progress** column.

I'll respond when you've added the pull request to the In Progress column of the v1.0.0 project.
