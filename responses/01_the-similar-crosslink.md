# How to find issues and pull requests

When you're working in a repository, you might want to find other issues or pull requests. Maybe someone has told you about a conversation, but they didn't send you a direct link. Or, maybe you remember an issue from the past but you don't know exactly where it is.

### Finding conversations

You can read all about the different ways to search in the [GitHub Help documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-open-or-closed-state).

### Creating Links

To learn about creating references, check out [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls).
