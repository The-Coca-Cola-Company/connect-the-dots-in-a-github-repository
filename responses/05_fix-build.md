# Fix the build

Now that you've seen that a status can be associated with a commit, let's fix this pull request up. The commit that you make will not only show the work you've done in history, but it will also show that you fixed the status as a part of a bigger picture.

People in the future could look for this work and find out lots of things. They could find who made the fix, what the build status was before the fix, or who asked you to make the fix. This information is created automatically, without any extra work from the developer.
