Welcome to this Learning Lab course about working in large repositories. For example, you could be working in repositories with a lot of history. Or, working with many collaborators. No matter how your repository is "large", it's important to know how to navigate your workspace.

Before you take this course, you may want to go through the [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course on Learning Lab.

In this course, you'll learn how to do lots of things, like:

- Find relevant issues and pull requests
- Search history to find context
- Make connections within GitHub to help others find things
