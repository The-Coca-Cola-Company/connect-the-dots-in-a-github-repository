Have you ever worked in a repository with a lot of history? Perhaps you've had to track down related issues and pull requests in the past, or you've had to find who committed a particular change. If you've ever found yourself in any of these situations, you'll know how important it is to navigate your workspace.

Before you take this course, you may want to go through the [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course on Learning Lab.

In this course, you'll learn how to do lots of things, like:

- Find relevant issues and pull requests
- Search history to find context
- Make connections within GitHub to help others find things

This course has a dedicated message board on the [GitHub Community]({{ communityBoard }}) website. If you want to discuss this course with GitHub Trainers or other participants create a post over there. The message board can also be used to troubleshoot any issue you encounter while taking this course.
